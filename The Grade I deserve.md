I think it is probably a 6

Things I've done:
Followed the tutorial and created hello-world repository, created branches within and tested pull requests.

I've joined fairy tail as a contributer, made several contributions to the fairy tale, both through the github site and uploading through the terminal. They were first done under Stephan without an github account, but afterwards done by SN-VD

Some of these were subject of a mismatch I had to solve, because everyone was uploading and changng at the same time

Posted an issue on fairytale and closed it after i joined

Created a small bio for my profile and added a picture of a spider playing drums as m profile picture.

Started following you, Aoife and Xuan

Forked your travis tutorial for later viewing (https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/travis_cpp_tutorial)

Domworld:
Created a repository for my project (Domworld) with MIT licence and a gitignore for .exe files and .cvs files

Added a Todo

Starred Domworld and the Presentatations of Friday 20.

Invited Redmar (who also works on this project) to join the repository as a contributor.

Activated Travis for Domworld. Still gives error, brecause there is no working code in the directory yet
