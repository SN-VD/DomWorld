# DomWorld
Project for Practical Bioinformatics

Domworld.py is a script that automates the process of simulating dominance interaction in Domworld, and extracting the data from the output csv files, which is used to create several graphs

However, I am not allowed to distribute cDomWorld.exe to other people. So instead, there are 2 sets of 1 config.ini file + the 5 produced output.csv files. These can be used to test all the functions of the script, except the use of wine to run cDomWorld.exe in a Linux enviroment. So you can either take my word for it that this line works, ask for a demonstration on my laptop or ask Charlotte Hemelrijk for permission to use it.
